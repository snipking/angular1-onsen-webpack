# Getting Started

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm`

## Installing

* `npm install` to install build environment dependencies
* `bower install` to install javascript library dependencies

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:
```bash
gulp run-dev
```

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server`, and scripts build with webpack will watch, build (in-memory), and reload by it; other resources will watch by gulp. Chrome browser will open with url `http://localhost:8384/index.html`.

```bash
gulp build-dev
```
* production build:
```bash
gulp build-prod:
```
